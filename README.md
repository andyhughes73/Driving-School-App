# Driving School App

This app is a project that I have chosen to learn coding in C#. I am also using it to learn web app architecture, MVC architecture and best practices for design and deployment.

If you see something that you believe will be of help and support for my learning journey, please feel free to contribute, share your experience and knowledge with me. It will be greatly appreciated.

This project is not for commercial use, purely personal learning benefit.

Thanks
Andy
